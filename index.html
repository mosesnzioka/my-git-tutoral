  <h1>THIS IS A GUIDE ON HOW TO USE GIT</h1>
    <h2 id="the-hover"><b>Get Started</b></h2>
    <h2>Set a Working Environment</h2>
    <p>Open your File Explorer and create a new folder of your own name,<br>
         open the folder you created and at the top side where there is something like a search bar<br>
        click on that bar and type a command <strong>cmd</strong> and press enter, that command will <br> 
    open your command prompt </p>

        <figcaption>This is the command prompt that open after the command cmd .</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>when the visual studio opens create a file named <strong>index.html</strong><br>
         and a folder named <strong>images</strong>  under the the folder you created before, for images you will use when developing your web.</p>

         <h2>What is Git </h2>
         <p>Git is a Version Control System.</p>
         <p>A version control system is a software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.<br>
            Version Control Systems allow users to revisit earlier versions of their files, compare changes between versions,<br>and undo changes.</p>
            <h4>Other version control systems are:_</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Subversion</li>
            <li>CVS</li>
            <li>Mercurial</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They all have a common goal but for now we will be talking about Git and GitHub.</p>
            <h2>What is GitHub</h2>
            <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration tools for software development.<br>
                It allows developers to host, review, and manage code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.<br>
                GitHub is built around Git, making it easier for teams to work together and maintain a history of their codebase.</p>
        
        <h2>Installing Git</h2>
        <p>First of all confirm if Git is installed into your computer and to do this follow following steps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the command prompt you open before type <b>git --version</b> and enter key.</li>
            <li>If a version number is returned, Git is installed on your computer. If you receive any other output, Git is not installed.</li>
            <li>If not installed use this link to download Git version on your computer.<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/" target="_blank">download Git!</a></li>
            
        </ul>

          <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
          <p>To configure Git does as follows</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To configure username type <b>git config --global user.name "USERNAME"</b>  and press enter key.</li>
            <li>To configure email type <b>git config --global user.email "EMAIL"</b>  and press enter key.</li>
            <li>For example if your username is daniel, type <b>git config --global user.name "daniel"</b> and press enter key.<br>
            and if your email is example@gmail.com type <b>git config --global user.email "example@gamil.com"</b> and press enter key.</li>
            <li>Rember that you should have a github account becouse the email and username should be as they appear in your github account.</li>
            <li>After configuring and type <b>git config user.name</b>or <b>git config user.email</b> should return your username and email as in your github respectevly</li>
            <li>the screenshort bellow represents my configuration</li>
          </ul>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>This is to confirm your configuration.</figcaption>

          <h2>Initializing Github Repository</h2>
          <h3>What is Git Repository</h3>
          <p>A git Repository is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.<br>
        A point to note<em> a project should have a single Git repository.</em></p>
        <P>Before initializing your git repository type <b>git status</b> to confirm if was initialized before becouse it should be initialized just once.<br>
            When you run the <b>git status</b> command and get the message "fatal: not a git repository..." being returned,<br>
             then it means that the project does not have a git repository, you can go ahead and initialize one</P>
        <p>To initialize Git repository go to your command prompt and type <b>git init</b> and press enter key.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/cmd4.PNG" width="400px" height="200px" alt="this is the command prompt">
            <figcaption>This shows how to initialize your repository.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        <h2>Adding files to the staging Area</h2>
        <p>Staging area is an intermediate space where you can organize changes before committing them to the repository.<br>
            When you make changes to files in your working directory, those changes aren't immediately included in the next commit.<br>
             Instead, you need to add these changes to the staging area using the <b>git add .</b> command.</p>
             <p>in Git there are two files which are <b>Tracked and Untracked,</b> and the difference between this files is that:_</p>
             <ul>
                <li><b>Tracked files:</b>git is aware of and is tracking for changes</li>
                <li><b>Untracked files: </b>These are files that exist in your working directory but have not been added to the repository</li>
             </ul>
            
             <figure>

            <figcaption>This shows how to initialize your repository.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>Committing file</h2>
          <p>A commit in git is basically a snapshot of your project at a particular point in time.<br>
        when writing a commit message you should ask your self this question<b>what this commit will do...?</b><br>
    the you write the answer as the commit message. To commit files you use this command <b>git commit -m "message"</b></p>

            <figcaption>Commiting changes in your Repository.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>To go back to previous commit and going to specifict commit you use this commands<b>git log</b>and <br>
        <b>git log --oneline</b> respectively.</p>

          <h2>Branches in Git</h2>
          <h4>Creating and Viewing branches in Git</h4>
          <p>Branch in Git is a separate workspace where you can work on new features, bug fixes,<br>
             or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branches are important becouse they anable colaboration.</p>
             <p>To creat a new Branch in your Git you use this command <b>git branch BRANCH_NAME.</b> To view branch you use this command <b>git branch</b><br>
            always the active branch will be colored. For example lets create a branch called moses_nzioka and view it.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="./images/cmd9.PNG" width="400px" height="200px" alt="this is the command prompt">
            <figcaption>To create and view branch in Git using command prompt.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Switching active Branch</h2>
          <p>To switch branch you type <b>git switch BRANCH_NAME</b> to your command prompt.
          For example lets switch to the branch we created before.</p> 
          
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/cmd10.PNG" width="400px" height="200px" alt="this is the command prompt">
            <figcaption>Switching to a certain branch.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>Merging Branch</h2>
          <p>Almost all the times, we want to incorporate things we've done in our branches into destination branch.</p>
          <h4>To merge branch:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>First, we switch to the branch where we want to merge the current branch. Then use this command<b>git merge BRANCH_NAME</b></li>
            <li>where BRANCH_NAME is the name of the branch we want to merge to the current active branch.</li>
            <li>Lets assum our official branch is called 'main' and we have content in a branch called 'moses_nzioka' that we want to merge into main</li>
            <li>We start by switching to the main branch where we want to merge the changes from 'moses_nzioka'<b>git switch main </b> .</li>
            <li>We then use the git merge to merge the content from moses_nzioka to main <b>git merge moses_nzioka</b> .</li>
          </ul>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/cmd11.PNG" width="400px" height="200px" alt="this is the command prompt">
            <figcaption>Merging branches.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>Deleting Branch</h2>
          <p>After working on branches and merging the changes to the main branch, usually we don't need that branch anymore,<br>
             and it is safe to delete it.<br>
            To delete a branch, we use the git branch command and pass the -d flag <b>git branch -d BRANCH_NAME</b></p>
